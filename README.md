# Automatic-timetable-generator-BE-project-for-mumbai-university
This web app has been created specially for my college affiliated to mumbai university.
This app generates timetable for all years simultaneously so that it becomes easy to manage all different resources involved 
such as teachers, subjects, classrooms,etc. 
User can manually adjust the time slots to their requirements too. 
Finally, one can print the timetables on pressing print button.
An admin account is present to manage user associated with each branch or department. 
Admin can also monitor timetables from all branches and years. Users can only work on their department related timetables only.
